# Certification-Projects
Web Development/ JavaScript Projects completed to obtain certifications from freecodecamp.org

This repository contains all the projects developed for the certifications offered by freeCodeCamp. Each certification requires the completion of five projects, each with its own associated link. You can find the official certifications below; by scrolling down and clicking on the "view" tab, then selecting "view project," you can explore the final results of the code included in this repository.

For the Front End Development Libraries certification, I utilized the code editor available at CodePen.

Please note that if you clone this repository, you will need to have the JavaScript Babel preprocessor installed to run the projects successfully.
